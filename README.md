# Smart-Vocalizer
A device which converts hand gestures to Audio signal.
The program takes voltage signals from the flex sensors and outputs its corresponding audio files according to the class in which the voltage level falls. 
As a prototype 6 audio outputs are used for testing. 3 flex sensors are mounted for sensing hand gestuures as a variation of resistance leading to different voltage drops.
